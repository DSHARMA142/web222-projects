              and migrate towards southern North and Central America during winter. This species can
              generally be found in open country habitats, including farmland, orchards, and suburban areas. In summer, both sexes are blue with rusty throats and bellies<sup>1</sup>. Males have brighter colors whereas females may show duller colors. Winter birds are paler blue on

          <ol>
            <li>The Eastern Bluebird is one of the most common Bluebirds in North America and is capable of migrating farther north than any other Bluebird in winter.</li>
            <li>It has the ability to digest 80% of wax-coated berries such as bayberries.</li>
            <li>The 2 types of subspecies, “Eastern” and “Western”, were once considered separate species. Due to recent generic testing, the same might occur again and these two might be treated as two different species in the future. </li>
            <li>A group of bluebirds has many collective nouns, including a "charm", "flamboyance", "plunge", and "quiver" of bluebirds.</li>

        <p>The Eastern Bluebird is a common bird and is nowhere near being endangered as it is widespread, and its numbers are increasing. However, this species, like many other common birds, suffers from human inventions and technology that we built.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>These birds get caught up in accidents such as collision with buildings, glass, towers and man-made structures. Adding to that, human transportation also contributes to the increase in death rates of these birds as they have less space to roam around.</li>
          <li>Communication towers also contribute a lot to the death rates of these birds. A 2013 studyshowed that, in the regions tracked, Eastern Bluebirds were among the top 10 species killed at communication towers.</li>

          <p>The Eastern Bluebird is a cavity nester and will nest in natural cavities in trees or in nest boxes. It has a varied diet that includes insects, berries, and fruit. The Eastern Bluebird is a year-round resident in parts of its range, but in colder areas it migrates to warmer regions.</p>

              <p>They are found throughout the United States at some point in the year. Males usually forage higher in the trees than females do.</p>
          
          <p>The Eastern Bluebird is one of the first birds to start eating berries in Autumn as it can digest bayberries and way myrtle berries. These Bluebirds get their food by picking insects from seaweed<sup>6</sup>, skimming the top of water for insects, raiding spider webs for a bite and even hunting through piles of manure.</p>
